# Surfs Up Analysis
## Overview
An analysis on weather stations database during the months of June and December in Oahu in order to help the decision making process regarding the opening of a business - surf and ice cream shop - in that location.
## Results
It was asked to compare the tempreature data in June and December for the past 10 years. Below are the key points:
- June average temperature was **75º F**
- December average temperature was **71º F**
- June maximum temperature was **85º F**
- December maximum tempreature was **83º F**
- June minimum tempreature was **64º F**
- December minimum temperature was **56º F**

Here is a more detailed statistical comparissom between both months, with a graph to facilitate the visualization:

## Summary
The data reveals what one would expect from a tropical island: Oahu temperature is mostly constant all year arround, averaging 75º F on summer, and 71º F on winter - not much of a difference.
To aid in the decision making, I also gathered the same info and stats on precipitation for the same months. The results are also promissing since the average precipitiation for June was 0.13 inches and 0.21 inches for December, again, not a significant difference. As can be seen in the graphics, the precipitiation is historically low on that island on both months, which is very good news for this bussiness.
